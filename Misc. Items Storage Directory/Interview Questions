Interview Questions:

Introduction & Set Context

Mr Pannuci told me your work system was rather archiac, do you concur? How do you feel about the system you have in place.

We are being paid by Pannuci to code computerised infrastructure to help you conduct buisness. What is the most important for you? Would you prefer for us to focus 
on the website and customer orders? Or would you prefer for us to focus on internal systems, such as which pizzas are being ordered?

Would you like us to add a delivery option? If not what extra features would you like to see in the website?

If yes, are there other extra features you wish to see?

If possible, would you like us to automate the cashier, so Mario can help in the kitchen instead?

Where can we find out what you sell for what price? Are there any special rules? Do you have allergen information on your products?
