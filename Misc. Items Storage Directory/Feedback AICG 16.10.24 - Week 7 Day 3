We looked at requirements from interview transcsript, Sherdianne was explaining what is on the transcript. We used it to make our Moscow model to fully map out what Mr. Paccuci wants to see.

We should of presented the interview before the requirements and the moscow model. We should have done the interview first and implemented it into the later charts.
We should elaborate more on the details in the Moscow Model.
We should be less stingy with the Must Haves.
We sorted the details in the Should haves and had the main things in the Must haves.
It was re-iterated that we should elaborate on the details, and the Should haves needs to have individual components rather than just mentioning details.
We had double details on the Should haves and Must Haves.
We had inconsistencies, with for example we state that we must be able to handle order, but then we put all the details and functions of the must haves into the should have. 
We have a misunderstanding with how the chair works because we set it to the chairs to be the main presenter not the only presenter. The Chair should be the one controlling the flow of the meeting with Jesus. 


We also made an interview for Mario. I was the interviewer and Martin was the Mario. I made a few questions to ask Mario. 

We should highlight the important parts in our transcript
