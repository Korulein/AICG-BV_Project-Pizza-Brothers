Project Plan

We have presented our project plan: Project Pizza Brothers. Overall, it is well-structured, though there are some parts open to reflection. Our mentor liked our approach to focus areas, which means we took the critique from the previous day and improved on it.

We might need a lot of luck attracting new clients due to our logo, but we stand behind it as a team. The language used in some sections could be clearer. When creating a project plan, clarity and directness are what we should aim for. The project goal outlines the solution to the problems, but we should aim to bridge the gap between the problems and the solutions.

Non-deliverables are the items we donâ€™t promise to stakeholders, meaning they should not have any expectations about those. We sorted out our disagreement over a subtopic in a constructive way.
